A Smart Reading device for BVI (Blind and Visually Impaired) - A integration of a complete Text Read-out system with a Dictionary query feature. The system consists of a webcam interfaced with raspberry pi which accepts a page of a printed textbook, producing an image document. Once the image is pre-processed, the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) package installed in raspberry pi converts it into a digital text document. Finally, the text is read out by a text to speech conversion unit (TTS engine) installed in raspberry pi through the speaker or headphone. The image can have text in English language.


For Dictornary Feature, The user can call the program with a press of a button and then the system interrupts whatever is being played and asks the user to say a word. After the user says the word, the speech is converted to text, and this text is sent over the web to find the meaning. This meaning is downloaded and is stored as a text document which is later converted to speech and read aloud to the user through a speaker.
